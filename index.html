      <h5>Best Vacation Ever!</h5>
      <p>We stayed here 2 summers ago for our family reunion and everyone had a wonderful time at the resort!  The large cabin was perfect for my extended family to be all together and the amenities were perfect!  We would love to come back again in 2018!!</p>

      <h5>Best Vacation Ever Too!</h5>
      <p>So many thanks for making our week so wonderful! I have to honestly say, my husband suggested to go to the lake and stay in a cabin for our families vacation this year and I was very hesitant. When I walked in our home my jaw dropped. This is not a cabin at the lake but instead a beautiful lake home. All your homes are absolutely beautiful! Your family was such nice hosts and the boys all had such a great time with your boys. They were such a good match of personalities. The boys didn't want to go home. We hope to come back for another vacation. We will definitely recommend you to others. Thanks for your kindness. Oh, the cookies were a great touch! Such wonderful memories.</p>
